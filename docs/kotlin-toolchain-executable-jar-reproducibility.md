# Kotlin Toolchain executable JARs are not reproducible across unchanged package runs

## Summary

With Kotlin Toolchain 0.11.1, running `./kotlin package` twice without changing
any project input produces executable JARs with different SHA-256 hashes.

The two archives have the same size, the same 225 entries, and byte-identical
extracted payloads. Their ZIP metadata differs because every entry receives the
wall-clock time of the package invocation. This defeats content-addressed build
caches. In particular, a Docker `COPY` of the executable JAR is invalidated on
every package invocation, which also invalidates an expensive downstream
GraalVM Native Image layer.

## Environment

- Kotlin Toolchain: `0.11.1 (801e9d4, 2026-06-05)`
- Project product: `jvm/app`
- Kotlin: `2.4.10`
- JVM target: `21`
- Java used for verification: Amazon Corretto `21.0.12`
- Host: Darwin 25.5.0, `x86_64`
- Executable JAR layout: Spring Boot launcher with application classes under
  `BOOT-INF/classes` and dependencies under `BOOT-INF/lib`

The relevant project configuration is:

```yaml
product: jvm/app

settings:
  kotlin:
    version: 2.4.10
  jvm:
    jdk:
      version: 21
    mainClass: io.sebi.tenchou.ApplicationKt
```

## Standalone reproducer

A separate minimal repository, `kotlin-toolchain-jar-reproducer`, contains a
single-function `jvm/app`, pinned Kotlin Toolchain wrappers, and a one-command
automated test:

```bash
./reproduce.sh
```

The script packages twice without changing an input, compares the archives and
their extracted trees, and builds a `FROM scratch` Docker image whose only
filesystem layer is the executable JAR. It exits nonzero unless it observes the
specific timestamp-only reproducibility failure and the resulting Docker layer
invalidation.

The verified minimal run produced:

468765ffbd725bacb13201e963e615e8bb4114e210483df40ba06fdc731b15fa  second.jar

ZIP entries with different timestamps: 130/130
Extracted payloads: byte-identical

## Minimal reproduction procedure

Starting from an unchanged, already compilable Kotlin Toolchain `jvm/app`
project:

```bash
repro_dir="$(mktemp -d)"
executable_jar="build/tasks/_tenchou_executableJarJvm/tenchou-jvm-executable.jar"

./kotlin package
cp "$executable_jar" "$repro_dir/first.jar"

sleep 4

./kotlin package
cp "$executable_jar" "$repro_dir/second.jar"

shasum -a 256 "$repro_dir/first.jar" "$repro_dir/second.jar"

mkdir "$repro_dir/first" "$repro_dir/second"
unzip -qq "$repro_dir/first.jar" -d "$repro_dir/first"
unzip -qq "$repro_dir/second.jar" -d "$repro_dir/second"
diff -qr "$repro_dir/first" "$repro_dir/second"

diff -u \
  <(zipinfo -v "$repro_dir/first.jar") \
  <(zipinfo -v "$repro_dir/second.jar")
```

The `sleep` only ensures that the second run crosses the two-second resolution
of a DOS ZIP timestamp. No project file is modified between the two package
invocations.

## Observed result

The two directly produced archives differed:

```text
a4c3ae6a5ed1bbe90e7e4766fb2cada303ec45ff52a9bc0f2642f6eff1ece1b8  first.jar
182dbcbda73eaec6315b79326a4617017388786e7833ffae291ddfa03de32ec9  second.jar
```

Both archives were exactly 22,227,580 bytes and contained 225 entries.
`diff -qr` over the two extracted directory trees produced no output: every
extracted file was byte-identical.

`zipinfo -v` showed the metadata difference repeated for every entry:

```diff
- file last modified on (DOS date/time): 2026 Aug 27 16:15:36
+ file last modified on (DOS date/time): 2026 Aug 27 16:15:40
```

The first differing bytes reported by `cmp -l` were the DOS timestamp bytes in
successive local file headers. CRCs, compressed sizes, uncompressed sizes, and
extracted contents were unchanged.

## Expected result

Two `package` executions with identical inputs should produce byte-for-byte
identical executable JARs:

```text
sha256(first.jar) == sha256(second.jar)
```

Ideally, the packaging task could also be skipped as up to date when none of its
inputs changed. However, even when the task executes, its output should be
reproducible.

## Docker and Native Image impact

The production pipeline uses the executable JAR as the input of a native-image
builder stage:

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/graalvm/native-image-community:25i2 AS native-builder

COPY build/tasks/_tenchou_executableJarJvm/tenchou-jvm-executable.jar /build/tenchou.jar

RUN jar -xf /build/tenchou.jar
RUN native-image ...
```

Docker keys the `COPY` layer by file content. Because the executable JAR hash
changes on every `package` invocation, Docker cannot reuse either the `COPY`
layer or the dependent `native-image` layer—even when all class files,
resources, dependency JARs, and configuration are identical.

In the observed application, JVM packaging takes only a few seconds while the
downstream native compilation takes roughly 48 seconds and peaks around 2.76
GiB of memory. The timestamp-only difference therefore turns a no-op package
run into a complete native rebuild. It would similarly cause misses in remote
build caches, artifact stores, provenance checks, and any deployment system
that uses the JAR digest as an identity.

## Root-cause hypothesis

The executable-JAR assembly appears to assign the current packaging time to
every output entry. The evidence does not indicate a changed compiler or
resource payload; after extraction, the output trees are identical.

A reproducible archive would normally use a stable entry order and normalized
timestamps, while preserving any ZIP storage requirements of nested executable
JAR layouts.

## Independent normalization experiment

As a diagnostic—not a proposed user-facing workaround—the two extracted trees
were repacked using the JDK `jar` tool with a fixed timestamp and stored entries:

```bash
jar --create \
  --no-manifest \
  --no-compress \
  --date=2020-01-01T00:00:00Z \
  --file normalized.jar \
  -C extracted .
```

Both independently normalized outputs had the same SHA-256:

```text
3f2e0c24a8976b119a64d3223ab3ef6ef54a6baa30ec38dbef833eadda49edd8
```

The normalized executable JAR also launched successfully and passed the
application health check. This confirms that normalizing archive metadata is
sufficient to restore reproducibility for the observed inputs. The use of
`--no-compress` in this diagnostic preserves the storage requirements of nested
Spring Boot dependency JARs; it is not intended as the preferred Kotlin
Toolchain implementation.

## Suggested acceptance test

A Kotlin Toolchain integration test could package the same small `jvm/app`
fixture twice in distinct clean output directories, then assert:

1. the executable JAR SHA-256 values are equal;
2. the archive entry order is equal;
3. every corresponding entry has equal content and metadata; and
4. a content-addressed consumer such as a Docker `COPY` layer remains cached on
   the second build.
